The challenge requires multiple commands to be run to make it work:

  sudo bash -c 'echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space'
      - Disables ASLR temporarily which is necessary for the challenge.
      - It is reset when the machine is restarted and can be added to a docker file or in sysctl for a permanent change.
      
  gcc one.c -fno-stack-protector -no-pie -z execstack -o plzwin
      - Command used for compiling the binary. It is precompiled in this directory

The challenge files given to the user include the binary itself and the c file if it needs to be made easier.
